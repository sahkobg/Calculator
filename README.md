# Calculator
I am currently learning how to work with functions in C++, so I decided to practice them by creating a simple calculator. The idea of the project is to understand how functions can be used to organize the code and separate each operation into its own block. Even though a calculator may seem like a basic project, it actually helps a lot with understanding how functions work, how to structure code, and how to think in small, reusable steps. My goal was not to make the most advanced calculator, but to learn how to split a program into smaller parts that each do one specific job.

The program starts by displaying a short menu that shows the available operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and power. After seeing the menu, the user types in the operation they want to perform, written as a symbol or keyword, followed by two numbers. For example, the user can type “+ 5 10” to add 5 and 10. The program then checks which operation the user chose and calls the appropriate function. Each operation has its own separate function, such as printadd(), printsubtract(), printmultiply(), printdivide(), and printpow(). Every one of these functions accepts two numbers and prints out the result in a simple and readable way.

One benefit of using functions like this is that the main part of the program becomes much cleaner. Instead of writing all the logic inside main(), I can just call a specific function whenever a certain operation is needed. This makes the code easier to read, easier to update in the future, and much easier to debug if something goes wrong. I also used the <cmath> library so that I could include the power function, which adds a bit more variety to the calculator.

Working on this project helped me understand how arguments are passed to functions, how to use conditional statements to choose between different operations, and how to organize code in a way that makes sense. Even though the program is simple, it taught me the basic skills I need before moving on to bigger C++ projects. Overall, this calculator was a good exercise for practicing functions and improving my understanding of how C++ programs are built.
